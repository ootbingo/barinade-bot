# Anti-Bingo

## Activation

Pick Anti-Bingo as the mode after creating a race. This can not be undone. Once the mode is activated the race will
*not* start automatically once everyone readied up.

## Phases of the Race

### Pre-Race

Anyone can join the room. There is no limit on the number of entrants. This phase will last until every entrant in the
race room is ready. Of course there must be at least two entrants.

### Row-Picking

Once everyone is ready the bot will send a DM to each entrant through the racetime chat. You will be informed who to
pick for. If there are at least four entrants you won't know who is picking for you. The bingo board will be set as the
race goal. Use the menu provided by the bot to supply the row you have chosen.

A chat delay of 90 seconds is activated. Racetime won't allow for more.

It is recommended to not post the choice more than 90 seconds before the agreed time limit, such that your opponents
can't see it, before you can see your row.

*In the future the bot will kick everyone who enters the race during this phase, since they won't be part of the row
picking process.*

### Race Start

Once everyone has picked a row the auto-start function is reactivated. Given that noone unreadied (please don't) the
countdown will start.

*In the future there will be a time window in which all rows must be chosen. If an entrant fails to pick a row in time
a random row will be provided to the opponent instead.*

At the end of the countdown you will get the filename as usual. Additionally, every entrant will receive another DM
containing the row they will have to complete.

Chat delay is disabled at the start of the countdown.
